To start off you'll need Nodejs and Yarn
Install them from

https://nodejs.org/en/ and https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/

N.B. you may need to restart

**** Install electron dependencies
1. Open this this text file is in, in your terminal/powershell
2. run command "npm install electron && yarn add electron-builder --dev" (it may take a couple minutes)

**** Setup your app
i recomend reading the electron documentation https://www.electronjs.org/docs, however this template is current set up to take your
web files (such as html,css,js and font files) in the '/BrowserWindows' folder
To start your app run "npm run start" or "yarn start" (i recomend using npm for this)


**** Packageing you app for distribution (or testing)
To package your app i once again recomend reading the electron documentation, how tempalte is currently set up to use 
"electron-builder (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)" and "electron-packager (https://github.com/electron/electron-packager)" to package your app for you

use command "yarn dist" to package your app for the platform your computer is currently running

use resspective scripts in "package.json" file to package for desired platform and architecture,
For example,
Command "npm run package-mac-x64" will package your app for Mac OS 64bit
and 
Command "npm run package-win-arm64" will package your app for arm windows

Personally i recomend using electron-packager for linux, and electron-builder for windows,
I have no apple computers so goodluck with that friend
